### Tic-Tac-Toe Game :

###### Tic-Tac-Toe Game Instructions:

1)-Setup: The game uses three buttons connected to RB0, RB1, and RB2, each performing specific functions.

2)-Gameplay Sequence:

Step 1: The user must first press the button connected to RB1.
Step 2: Select the row and column where you want to place your 'X' or 'O'.
Player Roles: Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'.
Step 3: After choosing the row, validate your choice by pressing the button connected to RB2.
Step 4: Click the button connected to RB1 again to enter the column number.
Step 5: The button connected to RB0 is used to choose the row/column number (first click = 0, second click = 1, third click = 2).

3)-Placement:

Once a player selects their row and column, validate the choice by pressing the button connected to RB2. The 'X' or 'O' will be displayed at the selected position.
If the chosen position is already occupied by an 'X' or 'O', an error message ('WRONG POSITION') will appear. The player can then re-enter the row and column by pressing the button connected to RB1.
